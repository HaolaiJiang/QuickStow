Project Name: QuickStow

**Core pain points:** We all have the experience that for some important but infrequently used items, we often forget where we put our things, and it can be frustrating and time-consuming to search for them. 

**User & context:** The user is me. the context is that when I amd done with one item and put it to a place for next time use. I need a quick way to record where I put it, and be able to find it when I need it, probably in a few months or years. The goal is to with minimal effort or no effort at all to record where I put it, and later be able to find it when I need it with minimal effort or no effort at all.

** Minimum Viable Product:**  What is the absolute simplest version that would still feel like magic? It would be a system where a single tap or voice command can record where I put it, and a single tap or voice command can find it when I need it.

** Objectives & Key Results:** How do we define success?

objective 1:  capture the item location with minimal effort or no effort at all
* key result 1: The capture action should be 1 tap or voice command.
* key result 2: The capture action should be able to be done with minimal effort or no effort at all.
* key result 3: The captured results should be saved in a location with recorded time and item name, for later retrieval.

objective 2:  find the item location with minimal effort or no effort at all
* key result 1: The find action should be 1 tap or voice command.
* key result 2: The find action should be able to be done with minimal effort or no effort at all.
* key result 3: The returned result should display the location of the item, and the latest 3 times it was captured, if any.
